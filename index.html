            <h2>About the breed</h2>

            <p>
                The story of the Roman Tufted Goose begins in Italy, 365 B.C.E.,  
                where legend has it the honk of a goose saved the capitol from a 
                midnight siege. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have yet to determine if our flock has any heroic qualities, but 
                my suspcion is that they largely lost in the genetic lottery.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are plump, hissy, and have anarchist tendencies. Their plumage 
                is entirely white with a tuft on top that resembles a little bird 
                bicycle helmet. Their bills and feet are a vibrant orange and 
                their eyes are blue. Ganders (males) have a thicker neck and a 
                louder honk. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, Roman Tufted Geese make excellent lawn mowers and mediocre friends.

        <!---How we got here--> 
        <section id="here">
            <h2>How We Got Here</h2>
            <p>It started with adorable little ducklings that we love with all our hearts. 
                Every day we would take our ducklings out on a walk around the yard to 
                snack on peas, bugs, and anything else they might want to forage. 
                As they continued to grow, we decided we wanted to give them free range, 
                but we were worried about their safety. 
            </p>
            <p>Enter <strong>geese!</strong> (AKA viscous feathered guard dogs.) 
                Geese will alert <u>very</u> loudly when there is danger and they’re particularly 
                astute to aerial predators like hawks, owls, and helicopters. 
                We also have high hopes that they might deter our little fluffy mutt 
                from showing affection to the ducks by putting them in his mouth. 
            </p>
            <p>So far, they’re very mediocre employees. There have been no duck 
                fatalities yet, so we’ll call it a conditional success. 
            </p>

            <h2>Meet Our Flock</h2>
            <p>Our particular flock of geese has been absurdly inbred for at least six 
                generations that we know of and though assured by the breeder that 
                “there haven’t been any problems yet!” we’re documenting new concerns 
                every day. (See: <a href="#behaviors">concerning behaviors</a>)
            </p>


            <p>That said, good entertainment is hard to come by in the pandemic, and 
                they provide plenty of it!

                    She has since found her flock, but still behaves as the liaison to 
                    the ducks. Gwen is a cousin to the other geese, who we think are

            <p>If we keep them until next spring, we’ll get to try goose eggs. I’ve never had 
                a goose egg before, but I imagine it takes cracking only one of these to

            <p>There is also the option of hatching and selling baby geese.
